<AOD re-reconstruction removing timing cleaning>
The CMSSW setup to run AOD re-reconstruction is not included in this package (It's in Yutaro's submit work directory).
The catalog of special panda files from the re-reconstruction is located in data/spikes/catalog.

<Minimal operations>

. skimUncleaned.py
  Runs skimUncleaned.cc on the special panda files and produces "offtime" skim files containing at least one
  barrel supercluster with pT > 170 GeV and -15 ns < time < -10 ns. Since the input MET is the default PFMET from
  AOD, which uses PF candidates with timing cleaning cut, contribution from off-time clusters are included
  here. The MET adjustment algorithm is not completely accurate, and may double count some contributions if
  clusters with pT > 15 GeV is not linked to neither a photon nor an electron.
  Superclusters that have no matching photon or electron are made into a photon object with whatever available
  parameters.
  The resulting skim files can be merged with a simple hadd.

. offtimeIso.py
  Takes the offtime skim and produce the plot-ready signal region skims.

. abcd.py
  Computes the estimate of the spike contribution in the signal region through a simple abcd method, using
  offtime and trivialShower skims.

<Additional studies>

. findSpikes.py
  Picks out AOD files and events that contain spike-like clusters.

. spike_digi.py
  Make a tree with ADC time samples of seeds of spike-like clusters. Takes a merged AOD file as an input.

. plot_digi.py
  Overlay many pulse shapes to identify spike- and photon-like pulses.
